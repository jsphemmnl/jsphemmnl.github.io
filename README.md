Learning Task 1: Personal Website

How you accomplished each item in the criteria?

- I have accomplished the items in the criteria by creating the website with the given guide on HTML and CSS. In HTML, the tags that I used such as sections and div helped me to group up certain elements that is better when it is modified together in the CSS code. In CSS, the selectors made it easier to pinpoint certain elements such as buttons to be styled simultaneously. The styles also made the website aesthetically pleasing to the eyes rather than being a disorganized website. Flexbox is moderately used in the website as it is useful and more efficient than other functions when it comes to organizing the elements. The website is somewhat responsive with all of the buttons having the functions and the use of media queries also made the website work on different screen sizes.

Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2

- When doing these tasks, I have learned about how to use HTML and CSS and I had generated ideas that can be built to websites with useful purposes.

Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2

- For me, the major struggle that I faced while doing these tasks is the confusion of certain functions, particularly CSS ID and class selector. Even if their functionality is the same, it is confusing for me to track on what selector should I use for my function to work on the elements that I want to style.

Website Improvements

- I could improve the website by learning more integrations in making the website so that the functionality will be better. I could also search up themes or style designs that is pleasing to me as the style design of my website right now is quite plain. The improvement that I want to implement in this website is the switching of the theme from light to dark and vice-versa.
